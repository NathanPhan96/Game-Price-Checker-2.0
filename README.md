## Game Price Checker 2.0


## App Functionality
We've developed an app to allocate pricing of video games based on user's designated region. The search bar allows the input of the video game you're trying to purchase. Submit button will bring up locations with pricing and top rated games. The user will also now be able to create an account on the website and have access to a dashboard that allows them to add to their own games to the database.


## Installation
N/A


## Usage
User will create an account and login to the website to view their dashbboard. The user will then search for the games they are interested in using the search bar. They will also have the ability to upload their own games to the app's database and this will be displayed on their dashboard.
